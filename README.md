# Database Configuration
The quiz data (questions and answers) is stored in MongoDB. You can either use a local MongoDB instance or connect to a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas database.

Configuring MongoDB:
If using a local MongoDB:
By default, the app connects to a MongoDB instance running on localhost:27017.
You can change the connection string in the app.py file to match your MongoDB configuration.
